    <h1>About the Studio</h1>

    <p>
    OddBird Studio is a collaboration of Sheridan Game Design students operating out of Oakville, Ontario. The team came together to create an engaging and memorable game to submit to the Level Up Showcase in Toronto. Although we are currently laying the groundwork for our debut title Arrow Heads we are passionate about creating games that are not only fun to play, but that push our design capabilities. While OddBird Studio may have started as a game project the team is always focused on moving forward with future developments; including a market release for Arrow Heads.

            Like everyone else on the team I&#39;m a student of Sheridan&#39;s Bachelor of Game Design.  I&#39;ve got an interest in programming and business although the allure of art is ever present and one day I will learn to &quot;art&quot; and &quot;git gud&quot; to use the words of our very own artist.  When I&#39;m not working I&#39;m usually playing a game with friends or binge watching a series.<span class="quote">&#148</span>

            I have spent most of my time with OddBird doing gameplay programming, and making sure everything looks and feels good together. I like designing systems, solving problems, making art, and long moonlit walks on the beach with my darling, Shae.<span class="quote">&#148</span>

            I&#39;m an artist who specializes in creating stylized characters and worlds. When I&#39;m not hunched over a Cintiq or an Intous, I often climb the online ladders of Street Fighter V in a desperate struggle to &quot;git gud&quot;. I also hate not working and being happy.<span class="quote">&#148</span>

            As the oldest member of the Oddbird team I like to think that I am a Hawkeye(Avengers)/father figure to my fellows designers. That being said you can often count on me to make a fart joke when it is unnecessary. I am an experienced 3D modeler having used 3Ds Max before the versions were dated. I am also not afraid to tackle other aspects of production such as rigging and animation. When not hunched over my computer I am playing hockey or drinking a brew, or both.

            I jump between tasks but I really love designing and creating new gameplay experiences, whether that&#39;s through levels, interactions or interesting systems. Outside of development I love archery and going on travel adventures to experience the food and architecture of other cultures.<span class="quote">&#148</span>

            Taking so much joy in shaping the way players maneuver through game environments I mostly focus on level design. When Iâ€™m not tinkering with levels I can often be found marketing our game to anyone willing to listen. When the work is finished however, it&#39;s time to play some games...uh I mean ... research!<span class="quote">&#148</span>
